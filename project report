HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION PROJECT REPORT
 INTRODUCTION
 This document presents a comprehensive report on the House Price Prediction
 project. The project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast housing
 costs based on key property attributes. Accurate house price prediction is crucial
 for real estate investors, buyers, sellers, and financial institutions, aiding in
 informed decision-making and market analysis.
 PROJECT OBJECTIVES
 The primary objectives of this project are:
 • 
• 
• 
• 
To develop a predictive model capable of estimating house prices accurately.
 To identify and analyze the correlation between property features (such as
 size, number of bedrooms, and age) and their market value.
 To implement and evaluate a machine learning algorithm for regression tasks.
 To visualize model performance and understand prediction accuracy.
 METHODOLOGY
 The project adopts a standard machine learning workflow for regression problems.
 The core methodology involves:
 • 
Data Loading and Preparation: Organizing raw property data into a
 structured format suitable for analysis.
Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features that influence house prices.
 • 
• 
• 
Model Training: Utilizing a regression algorithm to learn patterns from the
 training data.
 Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's predictive power using statistical
 metrics and visualizations.
 DATA DESCRIPTION
 The dataset for this project comprises information on various houses. The key
 attributes considered are:
 • 
• 
Features: 
◦ 
◦ 
◦ 
area: The total size or square footage of the house.
 bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
 age: The age of the house in years.
 Target Variable: 
◦ 
price: The actual market price of the house.
 It is noted that the current dataset is relatively small, consisting of only a few
 sample houses. For more robust predictions, a larger and more diverse dataset
 would be beneficial.
 TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED
 The project was developed using the following programming language and
 libraries:
 • 
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the machine
 learning model and data manipulation.
• 
• 
• 
Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used here to
 structure the data into DataFrames.
 Matplotlib.pyplot (plt): Essential for data visualization, employed to create
 plots that illustrate model performance and data distributions.
 ◦ 
Scikit-learn (sklearn): A comprehensive library for machine learning in
 Python. It provides tools for model selection, training, and evaluation. 
train_test_split: A utility function from scikit-learn used to divide the
 dataset into separate training and testing subsets, crucial for unbiased
 model evaluation.

Data Input:
 Load the sample house data (features: area, bedrooms, age; target: price).
 Data Structuring:
 Organize the data into a Pandas DataFrame for efficient handling.
 Feature & Target Separation:
 Distinguish the input features (area, bedrooms, age) from the output target
 variable (price).
 Dataset Splitting:
 Divide the structured data into two sets: a training set (for model learning)
 and a testing set (for model evaluation) using train_test_split.
 Model Initialization:
 Select and initialize the Linear Regression model.
 Model Training:
 Train the Linear Regression model using the features and prices from the
 training dataset. The model learns the relationship between input features
 and the output price.

Use the trained model to predict the prices for the houses in the testing
 dataset.
 Performance Evaluation:
 Assess the model's accuracy using: 
◦ 
◦ 
R² Score: Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent
 variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
 Average Error Calculation: Quantifies the typical difference between
 the predicted prices and the actual prices.
 Result Visualization:
 Generate a scatter plot comparing the actual prices against the predicted
 prices. The proximity of data points to a diagonal line indicates the quality of
 the predictions.
 Reporting & Interpretation:
 Summarize findings, discuss model performance, and interpret results in the
 context of the project objectives.
 RESULTS AND EVALUATION
 The model's performance is evaluated using quantitative metrics and qualitative
 visualization:
 • 
• 
• 
R² Score: A higher R² score indicates that the model explains a larger portion
 of the variance in house prices.
 Average Error: A lower average error signifies more precise predictions.
 Scatter Plot: Visual inspection of the scatter plot is key. If the predicted prices
 closely follow the actual prices (i.e., points are near the y=x line), it suggests
 the model is performing well. Deviations indicate areas where the model
 struggles.
CONCLUSION
 The House Price Prediction project successfully demonstrates the application of
 machine learning, specifically Linear Regression, to estimate property values. By
 analyzing features like size, number of bedrooms, and age, the model provides
 valuable insights into price determination. While the current prototype uses a small
 dataset, the methodology is robust and can be extended with more data to achieve
 higher accuracy and more reliable predictions for real-world scenarios. Future work
 could involve exploring more advanced algorithms, feature engineering, and
 incorporating additional data sources
