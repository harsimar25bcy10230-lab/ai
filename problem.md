1. Problem Statement / Introduction
Regular attendance is very important for students to do well in exams. Many times students start missing classes slowly and in the end their percentage becomes very low, so they get detained or face problems.
If teachers or college can get an early warning that a particular student may fall below 75% (or whatever the minimum requirement is), they can talk to the student or parents on time and solve the issue.
