PROPOSAL: AI-POWERED STUDENT ATTENDANCE PREDICTOR 1. INTRODUCTION This proposal is all about setting up an Artificial Intelligence system designed to give us a prior knowledge on student attendance. By using smart machine learning techniques, this tool will help us spot early signs of issues, so we can step in quickly to help students succeed and appear for exam.  OUR SOLUTION: USING MACHINE LEARNING FOR ATTENDANCE PREDICTION Our main idea is to use a machine learning model that can predict a student's likely attendance percentage based on their past performance. The goal is to train a model that can forecast attendance trends, allowing teachers and staff to focus their support where it's needed most. The Python script included here is a starting point for how we can achieve this goal
