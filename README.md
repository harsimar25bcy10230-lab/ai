PROPOSAL: AI-POWERED STUDENT ATTENDANCE PREDICTOR 1. INTRODUCTION This proposal is all about setting up an Artificial Intelligence system designed to give us a prior knowledge on student attendance. By using machine learning techniques, this tool will help us spot early  issues, so we can step in quickly to help students succeed and appear for exam.  OUR SOLUTION: USING MACHINE LEARNING FOR ATTENDANCE PREDICTION the main idea is to use a machine learning model that can predict a student's likely attendance percentage based on their past data. The goal is to train a model that can forecast attendance trends, allowing teachers and staff to focus their support.
